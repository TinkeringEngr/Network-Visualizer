# Network Visualizer

Network Visualizer is a open-source tool that allows everyone - not just security professionals - to visualize their computers network connections. Additional methods are in development to mitigate malicious activity from unwanted network connections. Network Visualizer compliments existing security methods and will grow in sophistication over time. <br><br><br>
