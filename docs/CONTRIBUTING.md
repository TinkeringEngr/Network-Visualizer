# Contributing

1. Have a conversation with me (TinkeringEngr). Talk to me about what you would like to do and how you would go about doing it. I can offer guidance and we can discuss tradeoffs, optimizations, and potential bugs.

2. Create a Github Issue for community discussion and feedback.  

3. Fork the Development branch.

4. Implement a working solution and send me a pull request. 

Hopefully one day I can pay people for their contributions, but as of now everything is volunteer.
